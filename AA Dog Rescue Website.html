<div class ="finlayText">
Finlay & his canine friend Ella have come into rescue together. They were originally rescued from a Chinese Meat Market when they were young. They now find themselves in need of a new home.<br><br>
Finlay is 11-12 years old and has been well looked after. Albeit he has been put on a diet! He is sociable with other dogs and walks well on a lead.<br><br>
THIS DOG IS IN THE UK AND AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION NOW!<br><br>
If you are interested in adopting him we would love to hear from you.<br><br>
If so, please download our Homing Questionnaire on this link: http://www.aadogrescue.org.uk/how-to-adopt and return it by email to: homing@aadogrescue.org.uk. Alternatively please email for further information.<br><br>
Click on his photo above to see more photographs of
Finlay on our Facebook page.

      Feature Dogs for Adoption<br><br>
      We now feature a select few of our dogs on a special page. They may have been with us a while and are being seriously overlooked through no fault of their own or they may be older or have medical needs.
      It may be that they are none of the above, just that they are a fond favourite of our team and we want to feature them in the hope that you will fall in love with them as we have.

  <h2>A SPANISH RESCUE DOGS TRUE EURO COSTS</h2> <br><br>
We wanted to give you an idea of the true costs of bringing a Spanish rescue dog to the UK as we are often asked how much it costs in relation to the adoption fee we charge.<br>
We are also frequently asked by our supporters if they can contribute towards sponsoring a Spanish dog for travel so this will give an idea of what the dogs need.<br>
As always we thank everyone for their support. With your help these dogs have a future they wouldn't otherwise have.<br>
If anyone wishes to sponsor a Spanish dog for travel a donation can be made by PayPal to: charley@aadogrescue.org.uk<br>
